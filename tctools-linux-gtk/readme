### Version 1.1
1. Replaced ../../utils by toolsdir=$( readlink -f "$( dirname "$BASH_SOURCE" )" ) in
`tsc`, `tgp`,  
2. Rewrote `tcp` in python for using in gtk (ubuntu)
3. We are not using `mc`
4. `tsc` now must be executed like this `. ./$tctools/tsc`, to include PATH in current 
environment.
5. `tcc` clears file, and copies result to clipboard using `tcp`
6. TCReader.java, java template, TCJavaPrototypeGenerator.h
7. `tre` - RunEditor, finds *h, or *.java and opens with editor.
8. `init` - set PATH. useful if shell was closed.
